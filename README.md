# DES-SD-AI-SupplyChainData
This repository provides a real-world inspired mobile sales dataset tailored for hybrid Discrete-Event Simulation (DES), System Dynamics (SD), and AI-driven optimization (Reinforcement Learning and Evolutionary Algorithms) experiments.
The dataset includes transactional timestamps, product identifiers, sales quantities, and customer regions, reflecting realistic supply chain flows. 
These variables enable researchers and practitioners to simulate operational events, analyze inventory behavior, and validate optimization policies within digital twin and hybrid simulation frameworks.
